title: About
---

I am a professional software engineer and Linux administrator. (Some
might say DevOp.) Currently I focus on functional programming
languages like Haskell, Scala or Nix, but I also wrote Python,
Shell-Scripts and C code professionally. When it comes to Linux
systems I have a huge preferrence for NixOS at the moment. But I am
also very familiar with the Debian family, including Ubuntu.

I am currently living in Ringgau which is a small district in
Northern-Hesse. That is basically in the middle of Germany.

German is my mothertongue, additionally I speak English and Spanish.
