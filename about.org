title: About
---

I am a freelancing software architect and software engineer. I have a strong background in Linux
system and network administration where I strongly emphasize systems as code using Ansible,
Terraform and NixOS.

I like functional programming languages using Scala and Haskell. I also program in Python a lot and
-- being a system administrator -- I also write a lot of Shell-Scripts. When it comes to Linux
systems I personally have a huge preferrence for NixOS. Professionally, I usually work with Debian
distributions and their derivatives.

I am currently based in the Lower Rhine regine (Niederrhein). This is a rural area in North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

German is my mothertongue, additionally I speak English and Spanish.
