title: About
---

I am a freelancing software architect and software engineer. I have a strong background in Linux
systems and network administration.

I like functional programming languages using Scala and Haskell. My way of thinking about systems is
strongly influenced by these programming languages. I also program a lot in Python and -- being a
system administrator -- I also write a lot of Shell-Scripts. When it comes to Linux systems I
personally have a huge preferrence for NixOS. Professionally, I usually work with Debian
distributions and their derivatives.

I am currently based in the Lower Rhine region (Niederrhein). This is a rural area in North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

German is my mothertongue, additionally I speak English and Spanish.

A list of my projects in German is available as PDF [[./static/projektliste.pdf][here]]
